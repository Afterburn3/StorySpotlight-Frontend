        While I enjoy reading extensively, I sometimes struggle to recall the
        key highlights of each book after finishing it. Hence, I've adopted the
        habit of taking notes to capture the most memorable aspects. My
        favourite books include 48 Laws of Powers by Robert Greene, 12 Rules for
        Life by Jordan Peterson and A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard.
