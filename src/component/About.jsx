            While I enjoy reading extensively, I sometimes struggle to recall
            the key highlights of each book after finishing it. Hence, I've
            adopted the habit of taking notes to capture the most memorable
            aspects. My favourite books include 48 Laws of Powers by Robert
            Greene, 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson and A Stolen Life by
            Jaycee Dugard.
